Scheduling

1. Write a CPU-bound task
2. Write an IO bound task
3. Run both in parallel and observe using time command. Also observe using htop or ps
4. Launch a process and change its priority using 'nice'. Observe CPU usage with top
5. Change priority dynamically
6. Run a program with real-time priority and observe (chrt)
7. Observe if linux is protected against spectre/meltdown
